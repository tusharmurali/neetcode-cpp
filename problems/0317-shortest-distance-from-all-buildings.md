## 1. BFS from Empty Land to All Houses

For each empty land cell, we want to know the sum of distances to all houses. BFS from each empty cell finds the shortest path to each house. If an empty cell cannot reach all houses, we mark it as blocked to avoid checking it again in future iterations.

This approach works well when there are many houses but few empty cells.

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    int bfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int row, int col, int totalHouses) {
        // Next four directions.
        int dirs[4][2] = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};

        int rows = grid.size();
        int cols = grid[0].size();
        int distanceSum = 0;
        int housesReached = 0;

        // Queue to do a bfs, starting from (r,c) cell
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        q.push({ row, col });

        // Keep track of visited cells
        vector<vector<bool>> vis(rows, vector<bool> (cols, false));
        vis[row][col] = true;

        int steps = 0;

        while (!q.empty() && housesReached != totalHouses) {
            for (int i = q.size(); i > 0; --i) {
                auto curr = q.front();
                q.pop();

                row = curr.first;
                col = curr.second;

                // If this cell is a house, then add the distance from the source to this cell
                // and we go past from this cell.
                if (grid[row][col] == 1) {
                    distanceSum += steps;
                    housesReached++;
                    continue;
                }

                // This cell was an empty cell, hence traverse the next cells which is not a blockage.
                for (auto& dir : dirs) {
                    int nextRow = row + dir[0];
                    int nextCol = col + dir[1];

                    if (nextRow >= 0 && nextCol >= 0 && nextRow < rows && nextCol < cols) {
                        if (!vis[nextRow][nextCol] && grid[nextRow][nextCol] != 2) {
                            vis[nextRow][nextCol] = true;
                            q.push({nextRow, nextCol});
                        }
                    }
                }
            }

            // After traversing one level cells, increment the steps by 1 to reach to next level.
            steps++;
        }

        // If we did not reach all houses, then any cell visited also cannot reach all houses.
        // Set all cells visted to 2 so we do not check them again and return INT_MAX.
        if (housesReached != totalHouses) {
            for (row = 0; row < rows; row++) {
                for (col = 0; col < cols; col++) {
                    if (grid[row][col] == 0 && vis[row][col]) {
                        grid[row][col] = 2;
                    }
                }
            }
            return INT_MAX;
        }
        // If we have reached all houses then return the total distance calculated.
        return distanceSum;
    }

## 2. BFS from Houses to Empty Land

Instead of searching from empty cells, we search from each house. Each BFS computes the distance from one house to all reachable empty cells. We accumulate these distances in a separate matrix.

For each empty cell, we also track how many houses can reach it. Only cells reachable by all houses are valid candidates.

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    void bfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<vector<vector<int>>>& distances, int row, int col) {
        int dirs[4][2] = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};

        int rows = grid.size(), cols = grid[0].size();

        // Queue to do a bfs, starting from each cell located at (r,c).
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        q.push({ row, col });

        // Keep track of visited cells.
        vector<vector<bool>> vis (rows, vector<bool>(cols, false));
        vis[row][col] = true;

        int steps = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            for (int i = q.size(); i > 0; --i) {
                auto curr = q.front();
                q.pop();
                row = curr.first;
                col = curr.second;

                // If we reached an empty cell, then add the distance
                // and increment the count of houses reached at this cell.
                if (grid[row][col] == 0) {
                    distances[row][col][0] += steps;
                    distances[row][col][1] += 1;
                }

                // Traverse the next cells which is not a blockage.
                for (auto& dir : dirs) {
                    int nextRow = row + dir[0];
                    int nextCol = col + dir[1];
                    if (nextRow >= 0 && nextCol >= 0 && nextRow < rows && nextCol < cols) {
                        if (!vis[nextRow][nextCol] && grid[nextRow][nextCol] == 0) {
                            vis[nextRow][nextCol] = true;
                            q.push({ nextRow, nextCol });
                        }
                    }
                }
            }

            // After traversing one level cells, increment the steps by 1.
            steps++;
        }
    }

public:
    int shortestDistance(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int minDistance = INT_MAX;
        int rows = grid.size();
        int cols = grid[0].size();
        int totalHouses = 0;

        // Store { total_dist, houses_count } for each cell.
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> distances (rows, vector<vector<int>> (cols, {0, 0}));

        // Count houses and start bfs from each house.
        for (int row = 0; row < rows; ++row) {
            for (int col = 0; col < cols; ++col) {
                if (grid[row][col] == 1) {
                    totalHouses++;
                    bfs(grid, distances, row, col);
                }
            }
        }

        // Check all empty lands with houses count equal to total houses and find the min ans.
        for (int row = 0; row < rows; ++row) {
            for (int col = 0; col < cols; ++col) {
                if (distances[row][col][1] == totalHouses) {
                    minDistance = min(minDistance, distances[row][col][0]);
                }
            }
        }

        // If we haven't found a valid cell return -1.

## 3. BFS from Houses to Empty Land (Optimized)

We can optimize the previous approach by eliminating the separate visited array and the house count tracking. The key insight is to use the grid values themselves as visit markers.

Initially, empty cells have value 0. After the first house's BFS, all reachable empty cells are decremented to -1. The second house's BFS only visits cells with value -1 (reachable by exactly one house), and decrements them to -2. This continues for each house. Cells that become unreachable are naturally pruned.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int shortestDistance(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        // Next four directions.
        int dirs[4][2] = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};

        int rows = grid.size();
        int cols = grid[0].size();

        // Total Matrix to store total distance sum for each empty cell.
        vector<vector<int>> total(rows, vector<int> (cols, 0));

        int emptyLandValue = 0;
        int minDist = INT_MAX;

        for (int row = 0; row < rows; ++row) {
            for (int col = 0; col < cols; ++col) {

                // Start a bfs from each house.
                if (grid[row][col] == 1) {
                    minDist = INT_MAX;

                    // Use a queue to perform a BFS, starting from the cell located at (row, col).
                    queue<pair<int, int>> q;
                    q.push({ row, col });

                    int steps = 0;

                    while (!q.empty()) {
                        steps++;

                        for (int level = q.size(); level > 0; --level) {
                            auto curr = q.front();
                            q.pop();

                            for (auto& dir : dirs) {
                                int nextRow = curr.first + dir[0];
                                int nextCol = curr.second + dir[1];

                                // For each cell with the value equal to empty land value
                                // add distance and decrement the cell value by 1.
                                if (nextRow >= 0 && nextRow < rows &&
                                    nextCol >= 0 && nextCol < cols &&
                                    grid[nextRow][nextCol] == emptyLandValue) {
                                    grid[nextRow][nextCol]--;
                                    total[nextRow][nextCol] += steps;

                                    q.push({ nextRow, nextCol });
                                    minDist = min(minDist, total[nextRow][nextCol]);
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }

                    // Decrement empty land value to be searched in next iteration.
                    emptyLandValue--;
                }
            }
        }

        return minDist == INT_MAX ? -1 : minDist;
